To build the project simply run the build.bat file in this folder like so:

c:\> build

This will run the nant build in default configuration. You can pass a target to the build.bat to run a specific
target in the default.build file.

To zip the project into a zip file run build passing a zip argument like so:

c:\> build zip

To override any of the build properties copy local.properties-exmple to local.properties and override any of the
property values in the default.build.
